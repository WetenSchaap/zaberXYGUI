# zaberXYGUI

Extremely simple GUI to control a Zaber xy stage. In this case specifically the X-LSM050A, but it should be very easy to adapt to other devices.

## Install

1. Make sure you have a Python environment installed with the prerequisites - or install them using poetry, if you know what that is. Prerequisites can be found in the `pyproject.toml` file.
2. Run `main.py` from the terminal.
3. It should just workâ„¢!
